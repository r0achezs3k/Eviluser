# EvilUser

**EvilUser** is a Python tool designed for generating visually deceptive usernames by substituting standard alphanumeric characters with visually similar Unicode homoglyphs. By employing Unicode characters from various scripts—such as Cyrillic, Greek, and Latin—EvilUser creates usernames that mimic legitimate ones while evading detection mechanisms that rely on straightforward character matching. This functionality is crucial for testing the resilience of authentication systems against username spoofing, assessing the effectiveness of security controls, and simulating phishing scenarios where obfuscated usernames might be employed.
